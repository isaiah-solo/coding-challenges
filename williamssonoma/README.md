# Williams Sonoma Coding Challenge

All of my code has been written in HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and ES6

It is a simple UI with a responsive experience in mobile. Clicking on the images provides a dialog box with a carousel of images with clickable arrows and thumbnails to traverse the images. Was not able to use ajax to grab the JSON (due to errors with https) but I downloaded the JSON and assumed JSON was already grabbed and parsed from there. Project runs by having all included files in the same directory, and then opening the index.html in a browser that supports ES6.

I went with a design different from the images that were provided in the email, in order to reflect more of what was on the Williams Sonoma site in terms of thumbnails. I did not use a framework as I knew I could accomplish this without one.
